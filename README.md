AutoTrader PriorityBlocker is a Google Chrome extension that aims to provide an easier vehicle search for users by blocking Priority Listings and several other Banner Advertisements on AutoTrader.ca.

2. Extract "AutoTrader-PriorityBlocker-main" from the downloaded ZIP file.

3. Open Google Chrome and navigate to "chrome://extensions".

4. Enable developer mode.

5. Press the "Load unpacked" button and navigate to and select the extracted "AutoTrader-PriorityBlocker-main" folder.

### Motivation

The AutoTrader ads kept blocking my vehicle search so I set out to make a simple fix whilst also practicing JavaScript!
